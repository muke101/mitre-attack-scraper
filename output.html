<h1 id="title-text" class="assistive" style="display: block;"><a>Windows Remote Management</a> </h1><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Mitigation</td><td><p>Disable the WinRM service. If the service is necessary, lock down critical enclaves with separate WinRM infrastructure, accounts, and permissions. Follow WinRM best practices on configuration of authentication methods and use of host firewalls to restrict WinRM access to allow communication only to/from specific devices. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dectection</p></td><td><p>Monitor use of WinRM within an environment by tracking service execution. If it is not normally used or is disabled, then this may be an indicator of suspicious behavior. Monitor processes created and actions taken by the WinRM process or a WinRM invoked script to correlate it with other related events.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<h1 id="title-text" class="assistive" style="display: block;"><a>File System Permissions Weakness</a> </h1><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Mitigation</td><td><p>Use auditing tools capable of detecting file system permissions abuse opportunities on systems within an enterprise and correct them. Limit privileges of user accounts and groups so that only authorized administrators can interact with service changes and service binary target path locations. Toolkits like the PowerSploit framework contain PowerUp modules that can be used to explore systems for service file system permissions weaknesses. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dectection</p></td><td><p>Look for changes to binaries and service executables that may normally occur during software updates. If an executable is written, renamed, and/or moved to match an existing service executable, it could be detected and correlated with other suspicious behavior. Hashing of binaries and service executables could be used to detect replacement against historical data.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
